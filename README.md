# CISC-59-Project
# Simpletron Simulator
A Python-based implementation of the Simpletron computer simulator, inspired by the Simpletron Machine Language (SML) described in "Visual C# How to Program, 5th Edition" by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel.

## Introduction
The Simpletron is a hypothetical computer that runs programs written in the only language it directly understands: Simpletron Machine Language, or SML for short. This Python implementation of Simpletron offers a concise way to simulate basic computer operations, including arithmetic and control operations.

## Features
-Memory: The Simpletron is equipped with a 100-word memory.
-Accumulator: A special register for intermediate storage and calculations.
- Instructions: Supports reading, writing, loading, storing, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, branching, and halt instructions.
-Interactive Menu: Choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, or input custom programs.

## Versions

### Version 1
- Initial implementation.
- Supported basic operations: reading input, addition, and displaying results.
- Command-line arguments for input.

### Version 2
- Enhanced user interaction with an interactive menu.
- Provided clearer prompts for user input.
- Simplified internal code logic and structure for better maintainability.

### Version 3
- Integrated additional arithmetic operations: subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Introduced error handling for invalid inputs and potential operation errors, like division by zero.
- Optimized memory utilization and streamlined user experience.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. The program presents an interactive menu.
3. Choose the desired operation.
4. Input values as prompted.
5. The result will be displayed.
6. Exit or choose another operation as needed.

## Instructions Supported

Refer to the source code or the original textbook for a detailed list of operation codes and their respective functionalities.
